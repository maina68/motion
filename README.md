# 2 option: Usin Parcel
This option requires you to have node installed.
Once you have Node.js installed, head to your terminal. When you installed Node.js, you also will have gotten a tool called npm.It manages JavaScript packages. What it allows you to do is install things from the npm registry. Let's try. Run the following:
npm install --global parcel
It's going to install a bunch of stuff for you so that you can then use the tool parcel. Parcel is a tool that makes it super simple to bundle all of your code together into one neat little package. You can also install whatever you want from npm and include that too!
